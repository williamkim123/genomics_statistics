# genomics_statistics
The project was about accessing a database with phenotypes that result from a specific condition or disease. The code was to efficiently organize the data
and access all of the parent/child relationships between different phenotypes. This specific code takes the a specific HP:0000118 as a parent root and 
finds all of the related children nodes.
